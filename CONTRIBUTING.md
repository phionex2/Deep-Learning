# Security Guidelines

Thank you for helping us keep the **Deep-Learning** repository secure! We appreciate your efforts to protect our code and users from potential security vulnerabilities. Please follow these guidelines to contribute securely.

**Reporting Security Issues**  
If you identify any security vulnerabilities or concerns, please report them directly to us rather than submitting them through public issues.

**How to Report:**

- Contact us at [tanishk.2132004@gmail.com](mailto:tanishk.2132004@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the issue.
- Include any relevant details that will help us understand and resolve the problem quickly.

Please allow us time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.

**Secure Contribution Practices**  
To ensure the security of the repository, follow these practices when contributing:

- **Update Dependencies Regularly:**  
  Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date to prevent vulnerabilities from outdated packages.

- **Conduct Code Reviews:**  
  All contributions should undergo thorough peer review to ensure no security issues are introduced.

- **Protect Sensitive Information:**  
  Never include sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or private data in your code. Use environment variables and `.gitignore` files to keep such data secure.

- **Use HTTPS for Cloning:**  
  Clone repositories using HTTPS instead of SSH to avoid potential security risks.

- **Limit Permissions:**  
  Only provide necessary permissions to collaborators to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or changes.

**Secure Coding Guidelines**  
To maintain a high level of security in your contributions, please adhere to the following coding practices:

- **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
- **Error Handling:** Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Handle errors gracefully and log them securely.
- **Encryption:** Use encryption for sensitive data both in transit and at rest where applicable.

**Continuous Monitoring**  
We encourage contributors to utilize tools like Dependabot and GitHub security alerts to monitor and address vulnerabilities in dependencies. Proactively maintaining secure code is a collective effort.
