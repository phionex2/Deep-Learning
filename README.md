## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Deep Learning Overview

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks. It involves multiple layers of processing to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data.

**Example:**  
In image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers might identify concepts like digits, letters, or faces.

### Perceptron

Perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm and the basic building block of deep learning models. It is a mathematical model used for binary classification.

![Perceptron Example](https://via.placeholder.com/600x200.png?text=Perceptron+Example)

**Perceptron Trick:**

\[
\text{Coeff\_new} = \text{Coeff\_old} - n \times \text{Coordinate}
\]

Where `n` is the learning rate.

**Problems with Perceptron Trick:**

1. **Quantifying Results:** It doesn't guarantee the best line for classification.
2. **Convergence:** The algorithm may not always converge.
