# Deep-Learning
 <p>This File contain all the concepts related to deep learning and still in progress........
All the data set on which I have worked in also included in this repo....or you can download it from kaggle.</p>
<p><h4><b>Basic Defination of Deep Learning:</b></h4>
Deep learning is a part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.It uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level feature from the raw input<br>
ex:In impage processing lower layers may identify the concepts relevant to human suchs as digit or letters or face</p>

  <li style="float">Perceptron is an alogorithm of an supervised learning algorithm which is designed in such a way that it become the basic building block of the Deep learning or you can that it is an mathematical model</li>
